# Problems with webRTC
A collection of issues limiting webRTC's adoption, specifically with a focus on video production

* Increasing playout buffer delay does not improve quality at all or very little
    * This is a huge issue.
    * It does increase the delay, but not the quality

* Changing play out buffer doesn't give control of underlying buffer ; just adds more. Makes play out quite variable
   * Changing buffer of video impacts audios buffer; not independent
   * Can't lower buffer or limit size for low latency
    
* Switching to TURN fixes issues with bitrate with ~5% of users
    * Doesn't auto switch
    * Not clear why this happens; peer to peer Internet routing issues; UDP throttling?
    * Seems to work for a second, then drops down to very low bitrates|
    * Adds a lot of cost to professional deployments where quality is important to paying customers
      
* Bitrates getÂ stuck at very low rates sometimes
    * reconnecting fixes it; potentially restart-ice works
    * reconnecting every minute isn't practical
    * can get stuck after seconds or minutes
    * not easy to replicate
        
* Cursor while screen recording
    * Screen capturing in Windows with browsers has the cursor show
    * the no cursor option in the screen capture settings does not hide the cursor
    * Forces users to have to use OBS to screen capture, which adds a lot of friction

* No application audio when window capturing in browser
    * Requires users to install to a virtual audio cable to capture window-specific audio sources
    * This adds friction and confusion to the experience
    * Capturing desktop audio then includes other sound effects
    * WHIP support in OBS might help here, but lacks flexible p2p support and data channels support
    
* Can't easily capture system audio on android (flutter); just mic audio (makes screen sharing pointless)

* Can't lock the resolution at a fixed resolution
    * content-hint a partial fix, but not fully
   
* Variable frame frames in screen sharing ; 57 /43 fps ; not 60.
    * Screen sharing in chrome doesn't seem to ever share 60-fps.
    * Window vs desktop vs tab results in different max frame rates
    
* No USB audio on Chrome Android or flutter
    * Chrome mobile and Flutter do not support USB audio sources
    * Forces custom native apps that are not accessible to most developers

* No USB video at all in Flutter or mobile browser
    * USB video support (HDMI to USB, Webcams, etc) 
    * Forces users to buy very expensive hardware or use SRT/RTMP native apps instead
    * some proprietary native apps now have WHIP support; lack NAT traversal

* Changing tabs will smash any canvas or digital effects, killing frame rates, making effects while video streaming hard

* No TCP to TCP mode for p2p
    * UDP throttling issues on some networks.
    * No guaranteed delivery method with peer to peer other than with data-channels
    * If UDP is required, it would be nice to have a guaranteed delivery mode that uses larger buffers

* H265 playback support in Chrome. 
    * Nvidia Jetson / iPhone can output H265 to WebRTC, but Chrome can't seem to play it back. 
    * SRT supports H265 but has higher latency and no NAT traversial
    * AV1 isn't adopted by embedded systems and most mobile phones yet
    * Would be a boon to IRL streamers to have improved compression rates of H265

* Can't encode once and reuse encoded stream
    * Unless using web-codecs, can't encode once and stream to multiple via the browser
    * low bitrate streams (\~500kbps) would be well suited for an inbrowser SFU

* No way to save stream direct to file without transcoding (lose quality/ higher CPU)
        
* Unless using Webcodecs, it's not feasible for one inbound encoded stream to be reused and forwarded to another user
    * This could open up the option of p2p2p
    * Transcoding lowers quality and uses a lot of CPU
       

* Chrome gets stuck at 35 kbps from time to time; restart fixes it, but just for a few minutes.
   * this issue used to happen a lot more often than it does now



* PCM has no FEC? Lots of clicking


* PCM doesn't support 48khz stereo just 32khz


* MP4 recording options missing
   * webm support with OPUS, maybe PCM, but most users can't convert
   
* Video recordings (webM) of webRTC tracks are typically variable framerate/resolution; unusable by most video editors

* FFMpeg.js requires shared array / strict same origin, making it inaccessible
   * can't easily use it in browser to do remuxing into different pages or audio conversion


* No transparency support; webcam, transmission, or playback. WebM supports it though. Vtubers and green screens need it.
   * can't playback webRTC with alpha channels
   * can't bring in video sources with transparent sources
   * webcodecs don't yet support alpha channels
   
* 5.1 / multichannel audio can't be published via the browser
   * stereo channel only with getUserMedia
   * 5.1 channel output mixing is hard to control; each 5.1 playback device handles it differently
   
* No ASIO audio support by the browser

* More open source background removal AI models needed; hard to compete with tech giants

* No control over amount of echo cancellation or noise removal

* Auto gain with mics yet Yetis fight for volume control with chrome AGC

* No way to increase maximum encoder quality target for high bitrate streaming
   * quality seems stuck at around medium-quality

* Vp8/vp9/h264 changes color/saturation - AV1 better? Depends on browser for encoding and playback.

* No way to control hardware encoder or check if available; forcing openh264 works

* Hardware encoder in windows don't really reduce CPU load. Openh264 lower cpu than the hardware encoder
